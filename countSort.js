/*
* The omega bound of comparison sorts such as Quick Sort
* and Merge Sort are Î©(n log n), and from the applicability
* of those types of sorts on certain data structures such
* as linked-lists for Merge Sort or low memory overhead
* costs for Quick Sort, makes them highly useful and quite
* fast enough for sorting large inputs. 
*
* However, outside of comparison sorting, there are even
* faster sorting algorithms, one namely Count Sort, that
* boasts an impressive running-time of O(n)!
* 
* Despite its space overhead and multiple for-loop
* iterations with miniscule amounts of operations in each loop
* keeping constants at bare minimums, Count Sort runs in
* linear time with its single-loop variant operations.
