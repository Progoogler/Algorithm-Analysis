# Algorithm-Analysis

This repo contains an exploration of the popular algorithms used in data structure operations.
These algorithms were rewritten in attempts to further understand the fundamental 
ideas and constructs involved in each particular algorithmic approach to solving its 
individual problem. Thereby analysis I mean such; not mathematical proofs that the 
algorithm works as it is meant to work. I think the belief in these foundational 
computer science algorithms require no further proving =D, only better understanding 
towards a wider audience so that each may be applied with certainty of correctness and 
applicability rather than just knowing that it works because some math genie wrote it.
